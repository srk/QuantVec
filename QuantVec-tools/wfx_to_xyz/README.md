Reads a  .wfx file (nuclear coordinates in atomic units), or text file containing a list of names of .wfx files (one per line) and produces 
an .xyz file containing the extracted molecular geometry (i.e. nuclear positions in Angstrom units), with the extracted total energy placed in the
.xyz file comment line.


If a text file containing names of .wfx files is used as input, the output .xyz file will contain one 'frame' of nuclear coordinate data per
.wfx file, with the geometry data written in the same order as listed in the text file. The .xyz file may then be read by other tools or 
visualized/animated using, e.g. the Avogadro GUI program. 


Usage: wfx_to_xyz <inputfile/text_filelist> <output XYZ file name>
